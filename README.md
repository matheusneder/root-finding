# ![image](root-finding-logo.svg) Root finding

Root finding of mathematical functions using numerical calculus algorithms writed in C language (C ISO/IEC 9899:1990). 

I wrote this project while studying numerical calculus on university. I migrated from Google Code (https://code.google.com/archive/p/root-finding/) to GitHub for archive purposes.

**This code should be useful to perform root finding in limited hardware such micro-controllers.**

Available algorithms:

- [Newton Rhapson](root-finding/src/RootFindingNewtonRhapson.c)
- [Cordas](root-finding/src/RootFindingCordas.c)
- [Bissecao](root-finding/src/RootFindingBissecao.c)
- [Pegaso](root-finding/src/RootFindingPegaso.c)
